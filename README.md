## What the hell is this

series is basically a TV Show tracker. You can use it to check when the next episode of some TV Show is going to air, or to list the names and air dates of previous episodes. You can also use it to help you rename your TV Show's files to something like "Some TV Show - S01E04 - Name of the episode.ext"

You can find information on what each file does in Configuration(https://github.com/ngserro/series/README.md#configuration).

## Installation

### Requirements

* An internet connection
* Ruby

Although `series.rb` works on any OS that has ruby installed, the helper script `series_helper.sh` will only work in a Unix like OS.

Before you download anything you should make sure that you have ruby installed.
Example for debian like OS:

```bash
sudo apt-get update;
sudo apt-get install ruby;
```

### Using Git

The repository can be cloned to any location.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngserro/series.git
```

### Git-free installation

To install without Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/ngserro/series/tarball/master | tar -xzv 
```

If you want to update you can simply run that command again.
